# --- Search Parameters ---
search:
  # Paths to scan for files.
  # Replace with one or more folders on your system.
  root_folders:
    - '/path/to/project'

  # Search folders recursively.
  recursive: true

  # Only include files with these extensions. Leave empty to include all.
  # Cannot be used when pairing is enabled; use
  # ``pairing.source_extensions`` and ``pairing.header_extensions`` instead.
  # Specifying both options results in a configuration error.
  # Cannot be used when any inclusion_group is enabled.
  allowed_extensions: []

# --- Output Configuration ---
output:
  # When pairing is disabled, all content is written to this file.
  file: 'combined_files.txt'

  # When pairing is enabled, each pair is written to this folder. Omit or set to null
  # to place the .combined files next to their source files.
  folder: null

  # Add line numbers starting at 1 for each file.
  add_line_numbers: false

  # Template written before each file's content.
  # The special sequence "{{FILENAME}}" is replaced with the file's
  # path relative to the root folder. Set to null or an empty string
  # to omit the header.
  header_template: "{{FILENAME}}:\n```\n"

  # Template written after each file's content.
  # "{{FILENAME}}" is replaced with the file's relative path. Set to null
  # or an empty string to omit the footer/separator.
  footer_template: "\n```\n\n"

# --- File Filtering ---
filters:
  # Files smaller than this (bytes) are skipped.
  min_size_bytes: 0

  # Files larger than this (bytes) are skipped. Omit or set 0 for no limit.
  max_size_bytes: 0

  # --- Inclusion Groups ---
  # Enable specific groups to only include listed filenames or glob patterns.
  # Mutually exclusive with ``search.allowed_extensions``; specify file types within the patterns instead.
  inclusion_groups:
    example_group:
      enabled: false
      filenames: []

  # --- Exclusion Rules ---
  exclusions:
    filenames: []      # Skip files whose names match these glob patterns.
    extensions: []     # Skip files with these extensions
    # Exclude folders if any directory name in the path matches one of these
    # patterns (e.g., 'build' excludes ./build and ./src/app/build). Case-insensitive.
    folders: []

# --- Content Processing Options ---
processing:
  compact_whitespace: false       # Compact and clean up whitespace
  remove_all_c_style_comments: false  # Drop all /* ... */ comments
  remove_initial_c_style_comment: false        # Drop first block comment if at file start
  line_regex_replacements: []      # Collapse blocks of lines matching regexes
  # Example line rule:
  # line_regex_replacements:
  #   - pattern: '^\s*\w+\(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+,\s*0x[0-9a-fA-F]+\),\s*$'
  #     replacement: '<data removed>'
  regex_replacements: []           # List of regex find/replace rules
  # Example rule:
  # regex_replacements:
  #   - pattern: '^\s*//\s*TODO:.*$'
  #     replacement: ''


# --- Pairing Options ---
pairing:
  enabled: false
  include_mismatched: false         # Include files without a pair
  source_extensions: []             # e.g., ['.cpp', '.c']
  header_extensions: []             # e.g., ['.h', '.hpp']
