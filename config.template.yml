# ================================================================
# Comprehensive configuration template for the File Combiner Tool
# Lists every available option with default values and explanations.

# --- Search Parameters ---
search:
  # Paths to scan for files.
  # Replace with one or more folders on your system.
  root_folders:
    - '/path/to/project'

  # Search folders recursively.
  recursive: true

  # Only include files with these extensions. Leave empty to include all.
  # NOTE: This option cannot be used if `pairing.enabled` is true or
  # if any `inclusion_groups` are enabled.
  allowed_extensions: []

# --- Output Configuration ---
output:
  # When pairing is disabled, all content is written to this file.
  file: 'combined_files.txt'

  # When pairing is enabled, each pair is written to this folder. Omit or set to null
  # to place the .combined files next to their source files.
  folder: null

  # When pairing is enabled, this template determines the name of each
  # combined output file.
  # Available placeholders:
  #   {{STEM}}       - The base name of the file (e.g., 'main' from 'main.cpp')
  #   {{SOURCE_EXT}} - The extension of the source file (e.g., '.cpp')
  #   {{HEADER_EXT}} - The extension of the header file (e.g., '.h')
  #   {{DIR}}        - Relative directory using POSIX separators (or '.' for root)
  #   {{DIR_SLUG}}   - Filesystem-safe version of {{DIR}} ('root' when DIR is '.')
  paired_filename_template: '{{STEM}}.combined'

  # Example preserving directory structure in the output folder:
  # paired_filename_template: '{{DIR_SLUG}}/{{STEM}}.combined'

  # Add line numbers starting at 1 for each file.
  add_line_numbers: false

  # Include a Table of Contents at the beginning of the combined file.
  # (Ignored in pairing mode and JSON format)
  table_of_contents: false

  # Template written before each file's content.
  # The special sequence "{{FILENAME}}" is replaced with the file's
  # path relative to the root folder. Set to null or an empty string
  # to omit the header.
  header_template: "--- {{FILENAME}} ---\n"

  # Template written after each file's content.
  # "{{FILENAME}}" is replaced with the file's relative path. Set to null
  # or an empty string to omit the footer/separator.
  footer_template: "\n--- end {{FILENAME}} ---\n"

  # Template written at the very beginning of the combined output file.
  # In pairing mode, this is written to the start of each paired output file.
  global_header_template: null

  # Template written at the very end of the combined output file.
  # In pairing mode, this is written to the end of each paired output file.
  global_footer_template: null

  # Optional placeholder to write when a file is skipped because it exceeds
  # filters.max_size_bytes. The string may use the {{FILENAME}} placeholder.
  max_size_placeholder: null

# --- File Filtering ---
filters:
  # Files smaller than this (bytes) are skipped.
  min_size_bytes: 0

  # Files larger than this (bytes) are skipped. Omit, set to null, or set to 0 for no limit (0 is treated as unlimited).
  max_size_bytes: 0

  # If true, skip files that appear to contain binary data (e.g., executables, images).
  skip_binary: false

  # --- Inclusion Groups ---
  # Enable specific groups to only include listed filenames or glob patterns.
  # Mutually exclusive with ``search.allowed_extensions``; specify file types within the patterns instead.
  inclusion_groups:
    example_group:
      enabled: false
      filenames: []

  # --- Exclusion Rules ---
  exclusions:
    filenames: []      # Skip files matching glob patterns (e.g., '*.log', 'tests/*').
    # Exclude folders if any directory name in the path matches one of these
    # patterns (e.g., 'build' excludes ./build and ./src/app/build). Case-insensitive.
    folders: []

# --- Content Processing Options ---
processing:
  compact_whitespace: false       # Compact and clean up whitespace
  # Optional overrides to enable or disable individual whitespace transforms.
  # Keys may be set to true, false, or null (to fall back to compact_whitespace).
  # Supported keys: normalize_line_endings, spaces_to_tabs, trim_spaces_around_tabs,
  # replace_mid_line_tabs, trim_trailing_whitespace, compact_blank_lines,
  # compact_space_runs
  compact_whitespace_groups: {}
  # If true, removes all C-style block comments (/* ... */). This runs *after* remove_initial_c_style_comment.
  remove_all_c_style_comments: false
  # If true, removes only the *first* C-style block comment if it's at the top of the file.
  # This runs *first* and also strips leading whitespace after the comment.
  remove_initial_c_style_comment: false
  line_regex_replacements: []      # Collapse blocks of lines matching regexes
  # Example line rule:
  # line_regex_replacements:
  #   - pattern: '^\s*\w+\(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+,\s*0x[0-9a-fA-F]+\),\s*$'
  #     replacement: '<data removed>'
  regex_replacements: []           # List of regex find/replace rules
  # Example rule:
  # regex_replacements:
  #   - pattern: '^\s*//\s*TODO:.*$'
  #     replacement: ''
  apply_in_place: false            # Apply these processing rules back to the source files
  create_backups: true             # Create .bak backups before rewriting when apply_in_place is true


# --- Pairing Options ---
